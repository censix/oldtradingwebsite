Realtime signal extraction .... and trading.

Could be interesting, since relatively easy to implement with out intraday framework, using 5-15 inute bars ....

The above uses CRBMs (Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines) which is an extension of RBMs that uses historical data, so it is sensitive to time and lagged inputs! A Theano(Python) implementation can be found here: https://gist.github.com/gwtaylor/2505670.  http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gwtaylor/publications/nips2006mhmublv/code.html. It seems that a CRBM can be used with either binary or gaussian variables see code for matlab:

Maybe use convolutional networks (makes use of GPU acceleration)  http://fastml.com/object-recognition-in-images-with-cuda-convnet/
