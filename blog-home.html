                <p>Instead of focusing on predicting price direction and price volatility with nonlinear models derived with machine learning methods, an alternative would be to try and discover exploitable price relationships between assets of the same class and react (=trade) when mispricing happens, in other words, do statistical arbitrage. In a sense this is somehow ‘easier’ than attempting to forecast prices, since the only thing one has to do is to find a relatively stable, linear or non-linear relationship between a group of at least two assets and assume that, from the time of its detection, that relationship will carry on for some time into the future. Trading under this assumption is then very much a reactive process that is triggered by price movements that diverge significantly from the modeled relationship. Traditional Pair Trading and trading of assetts in a VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) relationship are good examples for statarb using linear models. So why not use a simple one-layer neural network or even an RBM to discover a non-linear price relationship between two not-cointegrated assets and if this discovery process is successful, trade it in a similar way to a classical pair ? Things become even more interesting when groups with more than just two assets are considered. This would then be the non-linear equivalent of a VECM.</p>

                </h1>

                <p>Lets say we have a univariate timeseries predicition target that can either be of type regression or classification, and we have to decide what input features to select. More concretely, we have a large universe of timeseries that we can use as inputs and we would like to know how many we should pick (breadth) and also how far back in time we want to look for each one (depth). There is a two dimensional space of choices, delimited by the following four extreme cases, under the assumption that we have a total of N series and we can, at the most, look back K timesteps: (1) pick only one series and lookback one timestep, (2) pick only one series and lookback K timesteps, (3) pick N series and lookback one timestep, (4) pick N series and lookback K timesteps.  The optimal choice will likely not be either of those, since (1) and (2) may not contain enough predictve information and (3) and especially (4) will either not be feasible due to computing contstraints or contain too much random noise. The suggested way of approaching this is to start small at (1), see what performance you get, and then increase the size of the input space, either breadth or depth-wise, until you have reached satisfactory prediction performance or until you have exhausted your computing resources and need to either abandon the whole approach :( or buy a new (farm of) desktop(s) :)
