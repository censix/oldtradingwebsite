                <p>Instead of focusing on predicting price direction and price volatility with nonlinear models derived with machine learning methods, an alternative would be to try and discover exploitable price relationships between assets of the same class and react (=trade) when mispricing happens, in other words, do statistical arbitrage. In a sense this is somehow ‘easier’ than attempting to forecast prices, since the only thing one has to do is to find a relatively stable, linear or non-linear relationship between a group of at least two assets and assume that, from the time of its detection, that relationship will carry on for some time into the future. Trading under this assumption is then very much a reactive process that is triggered by price movements that diverge significantly from the modeled relationship. Traditional Pair Trading and trading of assetts in a VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) relationship are good examples for statarb using linear models. So why not use a simple one-layer neural network or even an RBM to discover a non-linear price relationship between two not-cointegrated assets and if this discovery process is successful, trade it in a similar way to a classical pair ? Things become even more interesting when groups with more than just two assets are considered. This would then be the non-linear equivalent of a VECM.</p>

                <p>Lets say we have a univariate timeseries predicition target that can either be of type regression or classification, and we have to decide what input features to select. More concretely, we have a large universe of timeseries that we can use as inputs and we would like to know how many we should pick (breadth) and also how far back in time we want to look for each one (depth). There is a two dimensional space of choices, delimited by the following four extreme cases, under the assumption that we have a total of N series and we can, at the most, look back K timesteps: (1) pick only one series and lookback one timestep, (2) pick only one series and lookback K timesteps, (3) pick N series and lookback one timestep, (4) pick N series and lookback K timesteps.  The optimal choice will likely not be either of those, since (1) and (2) may not contain enough predictve information and (3) and especially (4) will either not be feasible due to computing contstraints or contain too much random noise. The suggested way of approaching this is to start small at (1), see what performance you get, and then increase the size of the input space, either breadth or depth-wise, until you have reached satisfactory prediction performance or until you have exhausted your computing resources and need to either abandon the whole approach :( or buy a new (farm of) desktop(s) :)</p>

                <h1><a href="#"> Using Stacked Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines in R  </a>
                </h1>
                <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> February 12, 2014 </p>

                <p>
Stacked Autoencoders (SAs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are very powerful models for unsupervised learning.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing it looks as if there are no direct R implementations available, which is surprising since both model types have been around for a while and R has implementations for many other machine learning model types. As a workaround, SAs could be implemented using one of several neural network packages of R fairly quickly (nnet, AMORE) and RBMs, well, someone would have to write a good R implementation for them. But given that training both model types requires a lot of computational resources, we also want an implementation that can make use of GPUs. So at the moment the simplest solution we seem to have is to use <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>. It can use GPUs and it provides implementations of stacked (denoising) autoencoders and RBMs. In addition Python/Theano code for several other more exotic Boltzmann Machine variants is floating around the net as well. We can use rPython to call these Python functions from R but the challenge is the data. Getting large datasets back and forth between R and Python without using the ascii serialization that rPython implements (too slow) needs to be solved. An at least equally potent implementation of autoencoders that supports GPU use is available via the Torch7 framework <a href="https://github.com/clementfarabet/torch7-demos">(demo)</a>. However, Torch7 functions are called using ‘lua’ and calling them from within R instead will require some work at C level.
In conclusion: Use Theano(Python) or Torch7(lua) for training models with GPU support and write the trained models to file. In R, import the trained model from file and use for prediction.
Update 25 April 2014: The following nice solution <a href="http://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/rcpp-python/">“Call Python from R through Rcpp”</a> should bring us one step closer to using Theano directly from R.
